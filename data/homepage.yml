  title: "Who am I?"
  content: '<p class="lead">
    I love Product Marketing even before I did Product Marketing. I always liked telling stories, and being technical too, so when I got the opportunity to combine both I felt I had to do it. 
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I started my career with IBM AIX, WebSphere and Tivoli; at some point I switch over x86 architectures, virtualization and cloud, that is when I joined Canonical, the company behind Ubuntu. After a while I started a new job in Red Hat, where I spent almost 5 years of my career, I was there when it was acquired by IBM and I decided to take another challenge in Microsoft, and now I am working for SUSE.
